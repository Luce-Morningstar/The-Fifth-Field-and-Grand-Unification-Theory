  note = {
    Chapter 10 formalizes Measurement Field Theory through a collapse-driven evolution kernel. It introduces dynamic projection operators, imaginary feedforward redefinition, matter-antimatter collapse differentials, and field curvature feedback. Topological anchors, observer flux Lagrangians, and orbital phase resonance are mathematically modeled. Collapse entropy, retroactive feedback, and vacuum Hamiltonian deformation complete the field formalism. This chapter operationalizes Fifth Field dynamics as a recursive, topological, and definitional rewriting of physical law.
