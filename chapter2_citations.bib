  note = {This entry summarizes key works spanning temporal mechanics, imaginary phase space, rotational collapse dynamics, entropy gradients, and the emergence of irreversibility. These sources provide the foundational structure behind Chapter 2's exploration of time as an axis of potential rather than a linear quantity. Full citation mapping is provided in Appendix B.}
