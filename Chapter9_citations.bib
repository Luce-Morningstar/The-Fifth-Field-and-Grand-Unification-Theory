  note = {This chapter dismantles the myth of universal constants, reframing Planck's constant, the inverse square law, and the speed of light as emergent consequences of recursive observational collapse. Constants are exposed as local equilibrium artifacts in a non-uniform collapse lattice. It introduces adaptive redefinitions like $h'(x,t)$, lattice velocity-defined $c'(x,t)$, and anisotropic gravity via collapse attenuation tensors. The horizon problem is reinterpreted through void impedance in a measurement-dominant field, resolving causality without inflation.},
